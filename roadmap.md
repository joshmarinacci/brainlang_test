* koch triangle using logo rules using a rule map. needs matching/mapping and gfx.

# research and bibliography and open questions

https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(list_comprehension)

Look at what LINQ does.

```csharp
var ns = from x in Enumerable.Range(0, 100)
         where x * x > 3
         select x * 2;
```

is sugar for

```csharp
var ns = Enumerable.Range(0, 100)
        .Where(x => x * x > 3)
        .Select(x => x * 2);
```

how about 
```javascript
range(100) => select(where= x=>x*x>3, map:x=>x*2)
```
or
```javascript
range(100) => filter(x=>x*x>3) => map(x=>x*2) => show()
```


turned into block language
```
|--------------|
| make 0 to 10 | 
|--------------------|
| include x where    |
|  x*x > 3           |
|--------------------|
| transform x to |
|  x * 2         |
|----------------|
```


# Philosophy

* build your code up in pieces, incrementally. always be able to see the steps along the way
* learn as you code. shortcuts are just sugar for plain stuff. learn the plain then learn the sugar
* make a separate function, then inline it.

# Questions

* How can you show provenance? Include textual descriptions with links. Ex: [The 5 Fastest Rifle Cartridges](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-5-fastest-rifle-cartridges/ar-BB17nLBQ)
* How to auto-complete the `earth.circumference` part?
* How to make sure the unit `ft/s` isnâ€™t interpreted as actual division?

* define clamp to work on more than just scalars. could you clamp a color vector or a point vector?
* visualize vectors by drawing as arrows. how?  map list of vectors to arrows?
* how to let you work with components of vectors with xyz rgb etc when it's really just a list of two numbers underneath

[Eucliean Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector)


* What's the shortest possible raytracer using vector math. 
    * Loop over every pixel
    * generate primary ray
    * intersect with list of objects
    * find normal at closest intersection
    * calculate shading using lights.
    * project secondary rays and recurse

  
* what's a good syntax for anonymous functions / lambdas?

``` javascript
double = @(x) x*2
double = |x|x*2|
double = (x)=>x*2
double = x => x*2
double = lambda x: x*2
double = {x:Number -> x*2}
double(x) = x+y
```


* equality vs setting variables and pipeline.  Can pipelining to a new identifier be the same as setting a variable? ex:

``` javascript
// set the foo variable to the 'bar' string
var foo = 'bar'  //assign foo
var foo := 'bar' //assign foo
'bar' => foo     //assign to foo
(foo=='bar')     //comparison

```



# Possible Business Models

There is no business model for a programming language. They are cost centers. They also tend to
get better adoption when they are open source; at least in the 21st century. I think Java was the
last non-open source language to gain wide adoption.  Making HL is going to be hard. Not the actual
implementation, but the platform and the marketing to drive adoption and work with potential users. 
Plus a lot of the value will come from system integration (twitter apis) and data curation (useful
datasets) All that takes money. Wolfram Alpha is expensive to make and maintain.
So what are the options.

* *desktop software* Make it be an app you download and install. Charge once and for upgrades, or a subscription.
* *Donations* from individuals to a the HL non-profit.
* *SaaS for the platform*. Make a hosted version with built in datasets and API integrations. Language and std lib are still open source, and anyone
could host their own impl, just without the integrations and datasets.
* *ads* just slap ads on it. A completly free and open resource with ads. [Like these](https://www.worldometers.info/geography/alphabetical-list-of-countries/)
* *sponsorship* it's a public resource and big companies pay to be the sponsor. Think NPR sponsorships. The sponsor name is tasteful and on every page, just once per page.
* *sell books* create programming books on it that are sold.
* *sell cirriculum* if this really is that powerful, sell a curriculum based on it to schools and home schoolers and clubs.
